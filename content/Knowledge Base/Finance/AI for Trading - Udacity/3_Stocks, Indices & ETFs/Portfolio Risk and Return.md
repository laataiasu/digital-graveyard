## 1. Intro

### Understanding Portfolio Construction: Balancing Risk and Return

#### 1. **Introduction to Portfolio Construction**
In this part of the module, we're going to dive into the nuts and bolts of building a portfolio. Imagine you've done your homework: you've researched trading signals, analyzed market trends, and now you have a list of stocks you're ready to buy. You know how much money you can invest, but the critical question remains—how should you distribute your funds across these stocks?

#### 2. **The Balancing Act: Risk vs. Return**
Investing is all about balancing two fundamental concepts: **risk** and **return**.

- **Return**: This is the profit you expect to earn from your investment. Naturally, you might think that putting more money into stocks you expect to have the highest returns is the way to go.
  
- **Risk**: However, the stocks with the highest expected returns often come with the highest volatility, meaning their prices fluctuate more. While high returns are attractive, this volatility increases the risk that you could lose a significant portion of your investment if the stock prices drop.

#### 3. **The Core Problem: How to Distribute Your Investment**
The challenge is to figure out how to distribute your money across these stocks to not only maximize your returns but also minimize your risk. This isn't just a theoretical problem—it's a practical one that has puzzled and inspired financial experts for decades.

#### 4. **The Goal**
The ultimate goal is to find an optimal balance that offers the best possible return for the amount of risk you're willing to take on. This concept is the cornerstone of modern portfolio theory and is essential for anyone looking to construct a well-diversified and efficient portfolio.

### The Quest for the Solution
You're about to embark on a journey to explore this balance. You'll learn techniques and strategies to distribute your investments across a portfolio of stocks in a way that aims to maximize returns while keeping risks in check. This knowledge is crucial for constructing ETFs, managing personal investments, or working in any field that involves financial asset management.

2. **Covariance and Correlation**: Learning how stocks in a portfolio interact with each other in terms of price movements.
3. **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)**: An introduction to MPT, which provides a framework for constructing portfolios that aim to achieve the best possible return for a given level of risk.

### Mathematical Foundation
As you delve deeper, you'll encounter mathematical models and formulas that help quantify risk and return. Understanding these will enable you to make informed decisions about how to allocate your investments effectively.

Stay tuned as we explore these concepts and equip you with the tools to construct a balanced, efficient, and profitable portfolio.

## 2. Diversification

### The Importance of Diversification in Portfolio Management

#### 1. **The Dangers of Concentrated Investment**
Imagine you've identified a top-performing stock, New Digital Corporation, and you're tempted to invest all your money in it. At first, this might seem like a great idea, especially if the stock price continues to rise. However, if the price suddenly drops, say by 50%, your entire investment would be cut in half. This scenario illustrates the danger of **concentration risk**—putting all your eggs in one basket.

#### 2. **The Power of Diversification**
Now, consider a different strategy. Instead of investing all your money in New Digital, you split your investment equally between New Digital Corporation and Big Pharma Company. By doing this, you are **diversifying** your portfolio. Here’s why this matters:

- **Scenario 1**: New Digital launches a successful new product, driving its stock price up. At the same time, Big Pharma might be recovering from a setback, such as a failed drug trial, which stabilizes its stock price.
  
- **Scenario 2**: Big Pharma starts doing well, perhaps due to breakthroughs in its research, while New Digital faces challenges, like a change in management.

In both scenarios, the gains in one stock can offset the losses in the other, leading to a more stable overall portfolio. This is the essence of diversification—it smooths out the fluctuations in your investment value by spreading risk across different assets.

#### 3. **Understanding Risk in Diversification**
Why not just keep diversifying, adding more and more stocks to your portfolio? Theoretically, if all the risks faced by companies were independent (idiosyncratic risks), you could reduce your portfolio's risk to zero by investing in a large number of stocks. However, the real world isn't so simple.

- **Idiosyncratic Risk (Specific Risk)**: This is the risk that affects individual companies, such as a product launch failure or a lawsuit. These risks can be diversified away by holding a variety of stocks.

- **Market Risk (Systematic Risk)**: This risk affects all companies, such as economic recessions, inflation, or changes in interest rates. No matter how many stocks you hold, market risk cannot be eliminated through diversification.

#### 4. **Quantifying Risk: Understanding the Limits of Diversification**
To effectively allocate your money and minimize risk, it's important to understand the concepts of **idiosyncratic risk** and **market risk**:

- **Idiosyncratic Risk**: Can be reduced by adding more stocks to your portfolio. However, after a certain point, adding more stocks has diminishing returns in risk reduction.
  
- **Market Risk**: Cannot be diversified away, no matter how many stocks you hold. This is the risk associated with broader economic factors.

### Guidelines for Allocating Money
Now that we understand the types of risks, let's consider some guidelines for allocating your money:

1. **Diversify to Reduce Idiosyncratic Risk**: Hold a variety of stocks across different sectors and industries to minimize the impact of any one company's poor performance on your overall portfolio.

2. **Be Aware of Market Risk**: Recognize that no matter how diversified your portfolio is, you will still be exposed to market risk. This is where understanding the economic environment and your risk tolerance comes into play.

3. **Optimal Portfolio Construction**: Aim to find the optimal balance between risk and return. This involves not only diversifying your investments but also strategically selecting assets that align with your financial goals and risk appetite.

### Mathematical Approach to Portfolio Risk
To quantify and manage risk effectively, we'll delve into mathematical models that calculate:

- **Expected Return**: The weighted average of the expected returns of the individual stocks.
- **Portfolio Variance**: A measure of how the returns of the stocks in the portfolio move together. It’s calculated using the covariance between the stocks.

The combination of these metrics helps in constructing an **efficient portfolio**—one that offers the highest possible return for a given level of risk.

---

### Moving Forward:
In the next section, we’ll explore how to calculate these risks and returns using real data. You'll learn about key concepts like **correlation** and **covariance**, which are critical for understanding how different stocks in a portfolio interact with each other. This will set the stage for building a diversified portfolio that is optimized for both risk and return.

## 3. Portfolio Mean

### Constructing a Portfolio with Two Stocks: Calculating Mean and Variance

Let's dive into the process of constructing a portfolio with two stocks, \( A \) and \( B \), and calculate the mean (expected return) and variance (risk) of the portfolio.

#### 1. **Portfolio Weights**
First, we define the portfolio weights:
- Let \( x_A \) be the fraction of your portfolio invested in stock \( A \).
- Let \( x_B \) be the fraction of your portfolio invested in stock \( B \).

Since the entire portfolio is composed of only these two stocks, the weights must sum to 1:
\[
x_A + x_B = 1
\]
This also implies that \( x_B = 1 - x_A \).

#### 2. **Log Returns as Random Variables**
Assume that future log returns \( R_A \) and \( R_B \) for stocks \( A \) and \( B \) are random variables. These log returns can vary depending on different future scenarios, each with its own probability.

- \( R_{A,i} \): Log return of stock \( A \) in scenario \( i \).
- \( R_{B,i} \): Log return of stock \( B \) in scenario \( i \).
- \( p_i \): Probability of scenario \( i \).

#### 3. **Expected Log Return**
The expected log return \( \mathbb{E}[R_A] \) for stock \( A \) is the weighted average of all possible returns, where the weights are the probabilities of each scenario:
\[
\mathbb{E}[R_A] = \sum_i p_i R_{A,i}
\]
Similarly, for stock \( B \):
\[
\mathbb{E}[R_B] = \sum_i p_i R_{B,i}
\]

#### 4. **Portfolio Return in Each Scenario**
The portfolio's total return in each scenario is a weighted sum of the returns of the individual assets:
\[
R_{P,i} = x_A R_{A,i} + x_B R_{B,i}
\]
Here, \( R_{P,i} \) is the portfolio return in scenario \( i \).

#### 5. **Expected Portfolio Return**
The expected return of the portfolio \( \mathbb{E}[R_P] \) can be calculated by taking the expected value of the portfolio returns:
\[
\mathbb{E}[R_P] = \sum_i p_i R_{P,i} = \sum_i p_i (x_A R_{A,i} + x_B R_{B,i})
\]
Since the summation distributes across the sum:
\[
\mathbb{E}[R_P] = x_A \sum_i p_i R_{A,i} + x_B \sum_i p_i R_{B,i}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\mathbb{E}[R_P] = x_A \mathbb{E}[R_A] + x_B \mathbb{E}[R_B]
\]
So, the expected return of the portfolio is a weighted sum of the expected returns of the individual assets.

#### 6. **Variance of Portfolio Return**
The variance of the portfolio return \( \text{Var}(R_P) \) is a measure of the risk or uncertainty of the portfolio's return. To calculate this, we use the formula:
\[
\text{Var}(R_P) = \mathbb{E}[(R_P - \mathbb{E}[R_P])^2]
\]
Expanding this for our portfolio:
\[
\text{Var}(R_P) = \mathbb{E}[(x_A R_A + x_B R_B - \mathbb{E}[R_P])^2]
\]
Expanding the square:
\[
\text{Var}(R_P) = \mathbb{E}[x_A^2 (R_A - \mathbb{E}[R_A])^2 + x_B^2 (R_B - \mathbb{E}[R_B])^2 + 2x_A x_B (R_A - \mathbb{E}[R_A])(R_B - \mathbb{E}[R_B])]
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\text{Var}(R_P) = x_A^2 \text{Var}(R_A) + x_B^2 \text{Var}(R_B) + 2x_A x_B \text{Cov}(R_A, R_B)
\]
where:
- \( \text{Var}(R_A) = \mathbb{E}[(R_A - \mathbb{E}[R_A])^2] \) is the variance of the returns for stock \( A \),
- \( \text{Var}(R_B) = \mathbb{E}[(R_B - \mathbb{E}[R_B])^2] \) is the variance of the returns for stock \( B \),
- \( \text{Cov}(R_A, R_B) = \mathbb{E}[(R_A - \mathbb{E}[R_A])(R_B - \mathbb{E}[R_B])] \) is the covariance between the returns of stocks \( A \) and \( B \).

#### 7. **Interpreting the Results**
- The **expected return** of the portfolio is simply the weighted average of the expected returns of the individual stocks.
- The **variance** (risk) of the portfolio depends on not only the variances of the individual stocks but also on how their returns move together (covariance). 

If the covariance is positive, the stocks tend to move together, increasing portfolio risk. If negative, they move in opposite directions, reducing risk.

### Summary
By diversifying between two stocks, you can adjust the portfolio’s expected return and risk. The key takeaway is that the portfolio’s risk is not just a simple average of the individual risks but also depends on how the stocks interact with each other. This concept forms the foundation for modern portfolio theory, which seeks to optimize the trade-off between risk and return in investment portfolios.

## 4. Portfolio Variance

### Calculating Portfolio Risk Using Variance and Correlation

#### 1. **Reviewing Variance for a Single Asset**
Let's start by reviewing how we calculate the variance of a single asset. The variance measures how much the returns of an asset deviate from its expected return, providing a way to quantify risk. The formula for variance \( \text{Var}(R) \) when considering different scenarios, each with a probability \( p_i \), is:

\[
\text{Var}(R) = \sum_{i} p_i \left( R_i - \mathbb{E}[R] \right)^2
\]

- \( R_i \) is the return in scenario \( i \).
- \( \mathbb{E}[R] \) is the expected return.
- \( p_i \) is the probability of scenario \( i \).

This formula is similar to the traditional variance formula, but instead of dividing by the number of observations \( n \), we multiply each squared deviation by the probability \( p_i \) of that scenario occurring.

#### 2. **Portfolio Variance Formula**
Now, let’s calculate the variance of a portfolio that contains two assets, \( A \) and \( B \). The variance of the portfolio \( \text{Var}(R_P) \) can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Var}(R_P) = x_A^2 \text{Var}(R_A) + x_B^2 \text{Var}(R_B) + 2x_A x_B \text{Cov}(R_A, R_B)
\]

Where:
- \( x_A \) and \( x_B \) are the portfolio weights for assets \( A \) and \( B \), respectively.
- \( \text{Var}(R_A) \) and \( \text{Var}(R_B) \) are the variances of the returns for assets \( A \) and \( B \).
- \( \text{Cov}(R_A, R_B) \) is the covariance between the returns of assets \( A \) and \( B \).

#### 3. **Importance of Covariance**
The covariance \( \text{Cov}(R_A, R_B) \) measures how the returns of the two assets move together. It can be positive (when both assets tend to increase or decrease together) or negative (when one asset tends to increase while the other decreases). The covariance term in the portfolio variance formula is crucial because it reflects the benefit of diversification.

#### 4. **Correlation and Portfolio Variance**
We can express covariance in terms of correlation:

\[
\text{Cov}(R_A, R_B) = \rho_{A,B} \sigma_A \sigma_B
\]

Where:
- \( \rho_{A,B} \) is the correlation coefficient between assets \( A \) and \( B \).
- \( \sigma_A \) and \( \sigma_B \) are the standard deviations of assets \( A \) and \( B \).

Substituting this into the portfolio variance formula gives:

\[
\text{Var}(R_P) = x_A^2 \sigma_A^2 + x_B^2 \sigma_B^2 + 2x_A x_B \rho_{A,B} \sigma_A \sigma_B
\]

The portfolio variance depends on the correlation coefficient \( \rho_{A,B} \), which can range between -1 and 1:

- **When \( \rho_{A,B} = 1 \)**: The assets are perfectly correlated, and the portfolio standard deviation becomes the weighted average of the individual standard deviations.

- **When \( \rho_{A,B} = -1 \)**: The assets are perfectly negatively correlated. This scenario allows for the possibility of creating a portfolio with zero variance (perfect hedging) by setting the weights as follows:

\[
x_A = \frac{\sigma_B}{\sigma_A + \sigma_B}
\]
\[
x_B = 1 - x_A = \frac{\sigma_A}{\sigma_A + \sigma_B}
\]

In this case, the portfolio variance reduces to zero, achieving perfect hedging.

#### 5. **Real-World Implications**
In reality, perfect negative correlation (\( \rho_{A,B} = -1 \)) between two assets is rare, especially since all assets are subject to systematic risks, such as market-wide factors like inflation, interest rates, or economic recessions. As a result, the correlation between assets typically falls somewhere between -1 and 1, meaning that while diversification can reduce risk, it cannot eliminate it entirely.

### Key Takeaways

- **Variance as a Risk Metric**: The portfolio variance, which is the square of the standard deviation (volatility), is a crucial metric for assessing risk.
- **Impact of Correlation**: The correlation between assets plays a significant role in determining the portfolio's overall risk. Lower correlation (or negative correlation) between assets generally leads to a lower portfolio variance, enhancing the benefits of diversification.
- **Optimal Portfolio Construction**: Understanding these relationships allows investors to construct portfolios that balance risk and return effectively. By selecting assets with low or negative correlations, investors can reduce the overall risk of their portfolios, even if the individual assets themselves are volatile.

This understanding forms the foundation for more advanced portfolio management techniques, where the goal is to optimize the risk-return trade-off, ensuring that the portfolio is as efficient as possible given the investor's risk tolerance and investment goals.

## 5. Reducing Risk with Imperfectly Correlated Stocks

#### **Concept Overview**

Investors seek to minimize risk while maximizing returns. One way to achieve this is by diversifying a portfolio with stocks that are not perfectly correlated. Correlation measures the relationship between the price movements of two assets. If two stocks are perfectly correlated (correlation coefficient = 1), they move together in the same direction. If they are negatively correlated (correlation coefficient = -1), they move in opposite directions.

When stocks are imperfectly correlated (correlation coefficient between -1 and 1), combining them in a portfolio can reduce overall risk. This concept is the foundation of modern portfolio theory, where diversification helps to smooth out the volatility of individual investments.

#### **Mathematical Explanation**

Let's say you have a portfolio of two stocks, Stock A and Stock B, with the following properties:

- \( \mu_A \): Expected return of Stock A
- \( \mu_B \): Expected return of Stock B
- \( \sigma_A \): Standard deviation (risk) of Stock A
- \( \sigma_B \): Standard deviation (risk) of Stock B
- \( \rho \): Correlation coefficient between Stock A and Stock B
- \( w_A \): Weight of Stock A in the portfolio
- \( w_B \): Weight of Stock B in the portfolio

The expected return of the portfolio \( \mu_P \) is calculated as:

\[
\mu_P = w_A \mu_A + w_B \mu_B
\]

The risk (standard deviation) of the portfolio \( \sigma_P \) is given by:

\[
\sigma_P = \sqrt{w_A^2 \sigma_A^2 + w_B^2 \sigma_B^2 + 2w_A w_B \sigma_A \sigma_B \rho}
\]

#### **Key Insights**

1. **Diversification Benefit:**
   - When \( \rho < 1 \), the portfolio risk \( \sigma_P \) is less than the weighted average of the individual risks \( \sigma_A \) and \( \sigma_B \). This reduction in risk is the diversification benefit.
   - The lower the correlation \( \rho \) between the stocks, the greater the potential risk reduction.

2. **Perfect Negative Correlation (\( \rho = -1 \)):**
   - In the case of perfect negative correlation, it's possible to combine the stocks in such a way that the portfolio risk \( \sigma_P \) is zero, assuming the weights are chosen appropriately. This would mean the portfolio has no volatility, effectively eliminating risk.

3. **Practical Application:**
   - In real-world scenarios, stocks are rarely perfectly correlated or negatively correlated. Most stocks have a correlation coefficient between 0 and 1, meaning they provide some level of diversification benefit but not complete risk elimination.

#### **Example Calculation**

Assume the following:

- \( \mu_A = 8\% \), \( \sigma_A = 10\% \)
- \( \mu_B = 12\% \), \( \sigma_B = 15\% \)
- \( \rho = 0.3 \)
- \( w_A = 0.6 \), \( w_B = 0.4 \)

1. **Expected Return of Portfolio:**

\[
\mu_P = (0.6 \times 8\%) + (0.4 \times 12\%) = 9.6\%
\]

2. **Risk of Portfolio:**

\[
\sigma_P = \sqrt{(0.6^2 \times 10^2) + (0.4^2 \times 15^2) + (2 \times 0.6 \times 0.4 \times 10 \times 15 \times 0.3)}
\]
\[
\sigma_P = \sqrt{(36) + (36) + (21.6)} = \sqrt{93.6} \approx 9.67\%
\]

In this example, the portfolio risk \( \sigma_P \) is lower than the risk of either stock alone due to the diversification effect, even though the portfolio's expected return is a weighted average of the individual returns.

#### **Conclusion**

By combining stocks with imperfect correlations in a portfolio, investors can achieve a balance between risk and return that is superior to holding individual stocks. This is a fundamental principle in portfolio management, emphasizing the importance of diversification in reducing investment risk.

## 6. Variance of a 3-Asset Portfolio

To calculate the variance of a 3-asset portfolio, you'll need the following information:

1. **Individual asset variances**: \( \sigma_1^2 \), \( \sigma_2^2 \), \( \sigma_3^2 \)
2. **Pairwise asset covariances**: \( \text{Cov}(A_1, A_2) \), \( \text{Cov}(A_1, A_3) \), \( \text{Cov}(A_2, A_3) \)
3. **Weights of each asset in the portfolio**: \( w_1 \), \( w_2 \), \( w_3 \)

The variance of the portfolio \( \sigma_p^2 \) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\sigma_p^2 = w_1^2 \sigma_1^2 + w_2^2 \sigma_2^2 + w_3^2 \sigma_3^2 + 2w_1w_2 \text{Cov}(A_1, A_2) + 2w_1w_3 \text{Cov}(A_1, A_3) + 2w_2w_3 \text{Cov}(A_2, A_3)
\]

Here's a breakdown of the formula:

1. **Individual Asset Variances**: Each asset's variance is weighted by the square of its weight in the portfolio.
   
2. **Covariances**: Each pairwise covariance between assets is weighted by the product of their weights and doubled (since covariance affects two weights).

### Example Calculation

Suppose we have the following:

- **Weights**: \( w_1 = 0.4 \), \( w_2 = 0.3 \), \( w_3 = 0.3 \)
- **Variances**: \( \sigma_1^2 = 0.04 \), \( \sigma_2^2 = 0.02 \), \( \sigma_3^2 = 0.03 \)
- **Covariances**: \( \text{Cov}(A_1, A_2) = 0.01 \), \( \text{Cov}(A_1, A_3) = 0.015 \), \( \text{Cov}(A_2, A_3) = 0.012 \)

Plug these values into the formula:

\[
\sigma_p^2 = (0.4)^2 \cdot 0.04 + (0.3)^2 \cdot 0.02 + (0.3)^2 \cdot 0.03 + 2 \cdot 0.4 \cdot 0.3 \cdot 0.01 + 2 \cdot 0.4 \cdot 0.3 \cdot 0.015 + 2 \cdot 0.3 \cdot 0.3 \cdot 0.012
\]

\[
\sigma_p^2 = 0.0064 + 0.0018 + 0.0027 + 0.0024 + 0.0036 + 0.0022
\]

\[
\sigma_p^2 = 0.0191
\]

So, the variance of the portfolio is \( 0.0191 \).

## 7. The Covariance Matrix and Quadratic Forms

#### 1. **Introduction to the Covariance Matrix**

When dealing with multiple assets in a portfolio, it becomes useful to organize the covariances between all pairs of assets into a matrix called the **covariance matrix**.

##### Covariance Matrix Definition

For a portfolio with \( n \) assets, the **covariance matrix** \( \Sigma \) is an \( n \times n \) matrix where each element \( \Sigma_{ij} \) represents the covariance between the returns of asset \( i \) and asset \( j \):

\[
\Sigma = \begin{bmatrix}
\text{Var}(R_1) & \text{Cov}(R_1, R_2) & \cdots & \text{Cov}(R_1, R_n) \\
\text{Cov}(R_2, R_1) & \text{Var}(R_2) & \cdots & \text{Cov}(R_2, R_n) \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\text{Cov}(R_n, R_1) & \text{Cov}(R_n, R_2) & \cdots & \text{Var}(R_n)
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Here:
- \( \text{Var}(R_i) \) is the variance of asset \( i \).
- \( \text{Cov}(R_i, R_j) \) is the covariance between the returns of assets \( i \) and \( j \).

The covariance matrix is **symmetric** because \( \text{Cov}(R_i, R_j) = \text{Cov}(R_j, R_i) \).

#### 2. **Using the Covariance Matrix in Portfolio Risk**

Given the covariance matrix \( \Sigma \) and a vector of portfolio weights \( \mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n]^T \), we can express the variance of the portfolio’s return using a **quadratic form**:

\[
\text{Var}(R_P) = \mathbf{x}^T \Sigma \mathbf{x}
\]

##### Explanation:
- \( \mathbf{x}^T \) is the transpose of the weight vector, a \( 1 \times n \) row vector.
- \( \Sigma \) is the \( n \times n \) covariance matrix.
- \( \mathbf{x} \) is the \( n \times 1 \) column vector of portfolio weights.

#### 3. **Portfolio Variance Example**

Let’s consider a simple example with three assets \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) with portfolio weights \( x_A \), \( x_B \), and \( x_C \).

##### Covariance Matrix
Assume the covariance matrix \( \Sigma \) is given by:

\[
\Sigma = \begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_A^2 & \sigma_{AB} & \sigma_{AC} \\
\sigma_{BA} & \sigma_B^2 & \sigma_{BC} \\
\sigma_{CA} & \sigma_{CB} & \sigma_C^2
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Where:
- \( \sigma_A^2 = \text{Var}(R_A) \) is the variance of asset \( A \).
- \( \sigma_{AB} = \text{Cov}(R_A, R_B) \) is the covariance between assets \( A \) and \( B \).
- Similarly for other entries.

##### Portfolio Weights Vector
The portfolio weights vector is:

\[
\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix}
x_A \\
x_B \\
x_C
\end{bmatrix}
\]

##### Portfolio Variance Calculation
The portfolio variance \( \text{Var}(R_P) \) is calculated using the quadratic form:

\[
\text{Var}(R_P) = \begin{bmatrix}
x_A & x_B & x_C
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_A^2 & \sigma_{AB} & \sigma_{AC} \\
\sigma_{BA} & \sigma_B^2 & \sigma_{BC} \\
\sigma_{CA} & \sigma_{CB} & \sigma_C^2
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x_A \\
x_B \\
x_C
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Expanding this multiplication:

\[
\text{Var}(R_P) = x_A^2 \sigma_A^2 + x_B^2 \sigma_B^2 + x_C^2 \sigma_C^2 + 2x_A x_B \sigma_{AB} + 2x_A x_C \sigma_{AC} + 2x_B x_C \sigma_{BC}
\]

This equation accounts for both the individual variances of the assets and their covariances with each other.

#### 4. **Quadratic Forms in Portfolio Optimization**

The quadratic form \( \mathbf{x}^T \Sigma \mathbf{x} \) is central to **portfolio optimization**, where the goal is to minimize portfolio risk (variance) for a given level of expected return. This involves finding the optimal weights \( \mathbf{x} \) that minimize the quadratic form, subject to constraints such as the sum of the weights equaling one (i.e., fully invested portfolio).

##### Example: Minimum Variance Portfolio
To find the minimum variance portfolio, you would solve the following optimization problem:

\[
\min_{\mathbf{x}} \quad \mathbf{x}^T \Sigma \mathbf{x}
\]
\[
\text{subject to} \quad \mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{1} = 1
\]

Where \( \mathbf{1} \) is a vector of ones, ensuring the sum of the weights equals one.

### Summary

- **Covariance Matrix**: A tool to capture the variance of individual assets and their covariances with other assets in a portfolio.
- **Quadratic Forms**: Used to calculate the portfolio variance, which is essential for assessing risk and performing portfolio optimization.
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Involves minimizing the portfolio variance (risk) for a given return, which can be achieved using the quadratic form \( \mathbf{x}^T \Sigma \mathbf{x} \) in conjunction with appropriate constraints.

## 8. The Efficient Frontier

You've been tasked with investing $10,000 in five different stocks (A, B, C, D, and E), and your goal is to maximize returns while minimizing risk. To accomplish this, we need to understand the concept of the **efficient frontier** and how it helps in portfolio optimization.

### Recap: Portfolio Return and Risk

1. **Expected Return of a Portfolio:**
   \[
   E(R_p) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot E(R_i)
   \]
   - \(E(R_p)\) = Expected return of the portfolio.
   - \(w_i\) = Weight of stock \(i\) in the portfolio.
   - \(E(R_i)\) = Expected return of stock \(i\).

2. **Variance of a Portfolio:**
   \[
   \text{Var}(R_p) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} w_i \cdot w_j \cdot \text{Cov}(R_i, R_j)
   \]
   - \(\text{Var}(R_p)\) = Variance of the portfolio.
   - \(\text{Cov}(R_i, R_j)\) = Covariance between returns of stocks \(i\) and \(j\).

### Exploring Portfolio Combinations

You started by creating portfolios with different weight combinations to find the optimal mix that gives the highest return for the lowest risk.

#### Example 1: Equal Weight Portfolio
- **Weights:** \(w_A = w_B = w_C = w_D = w_E = 0.20\)
- **Portfolio Return:** 4%
- **Portfolio Standard Deviation:** 3%

Is this portfolio good enough? Perhaps, but there's a way to find better combinations. You continued experimenting with different weights, realizing that some portfolios with the same risk had higher returns than others. This led you to discover an important pattern.

### The Efficient Frontier

When you simulate thousands of portfolios and plot their returns against their risks (volatility), you notice that:

- **Efficient Frontier:** The upper boundary of the plot represents the set of portfolios with the highest return for a given level of risk. These portfolios are known as **efficient portfolios**.
  
- **Dominated Portfolios:** Any portfolio below the efficient frontier is less attractive because there's always another portfolio with the same risk but higher return.

- **Minimum Variance Portfolio:** This is the portfolio with the lowest possible risk. It lies at the leftmost point of the efficient frontier.

#### Example: Red vs. Yellow Dots
- **Red Dot Portfolio:** Expected return of 6%, risk (volatility) of 3.5%.
- **Yellow Dot Portfolio:** Expected return of 5%, risk of 3.5%.

Given the same risk, the red portfolio is preferable because it offers a higher return. The efficient frontier shows that any rational investor should aim to pick portfolios along this boundary.

### Conclusion

The efficient frontier is a powerful concept in portfolio optimization. It shows the trade-off between risk and return and helps you identify the best possible portfolios. By understanding and applying these concepts, you can create portfolios that impress your manager by maximizing returns while carefully managing risk.

## 9. Capital Market Line

### Introduction to the Capital Market Line (CML)

In this lesson, we're going to enhance our understanding of portfolio theory by introducing the **Capital Market Line (CML)**. Previously, you learned about the **Efficient Frontier**, which represents the set of optimal portfolios offering the best possible return for a given level of risk. Now, we'll see how introducing a **risk-free asset** into the mix can improve upon the efficient frontier.

### Understanding the Risk-Free Asset

A **risk-free asset** is an investment that theoretically carries no risk and provides a guaranteed rate of return. Although no investment is entirely risk-free in reality, the rate of return on a three-month U.S. Treasury bill is commonly used as a proxy for the **risk-free rate**.

### Combining Risk-Free and Risky Assets

Imagine constructing a new portfolio by combining a **risk-free asset** with any portfolio on the efficient frontier, referred to as a **market portfolio**. The expected return of this portfolio can be expressed as a weighted sum of the returns from the risk-free asset and the chosen market portfolio.

Consider a scenario where you choose a specific market portfolio and combine it with the risk-free asset. The line that connects the two points (risk-free asset and market portfolio) represents all possible combinations of these two assets.

### The Optimal Market Portfolio: Tangency Portfolio

To maximize returns for a given level of risk, you should choose the market portfolio that allows you to draw a straight line from the risk-free rate to the top of the efficient frontier. This line will be **tangent** to the efficient frontier at one specific point. This point is called the **tangency portfolio**, and the line itself is known as the **Capital Market Line (CML)**.

### Capital Market Line (CML) Explained

The CML represents portfolios that optimally combine the risk-free asset with the market portfolio to achieve the best possible risk-return trade-off. The formula for the expected return of a portfolio on the CML is:

\[
E(R_p) = R_f + \left(\frac{E(R_m) - R_f}{\sigma_m}\right) \sigma_p
\]

Where:
- \(E(R_p)\) is the expected return of the portfolio.
- \(R_f\) is the risk-free rate.
- \(E(R_m)\) is the expected return of the market portfolio.
- \(\sigma_m\) is the volatility (standard deviation) of the market portfolio.
- \(\sigma_p\) is the volatility of the portfolio.

The slope of the CML, \(\frac{E(R_m) - R_f}{\sigma_m}\), is known as the **Sharpe Ratio** of the market, which measures the excess return per unit of risk.

### The Significance of the Sharpe Ratio

The Sharpe Ratio is crucial because it quantifies the reward-to-risk ratio. Professional investors use it to evaluate the performance of portfolios. By leveraging or shorting the risk-free asset, they can achieve any desired combination of risk and return along the CML.

### Extending Beyond the Tangency Portfolio

If you can borrow at the risk-free rate, you can take on portfolios with higher risk and return by moving to the right of the tangency portfolio on the CML. This is done by **shorting** the risk-free asset, effectively creating a portfolio with leverage.

### Conclusion

The CML provides a powerful framework for understanding the trade-off between risk and return. By combining a risk-free asset with a market portfolio, you can achieve better returns for a given level of risk compared to portfolios on the efficient frontier alone. The Sharpe Ratio plays a central role in this analysis, making it a key metric for evaluating portfolio performance.

## 10. Sharpe Ratio

The Sharpe Ratio is a measure used in finance to evaluate the return of an investment compared to its risk. It's essentially a way to understand how much excess return you are receiving for the extra volatility that you endure for holding a riskier asset.

The formula for the Sharpe Ratio is:

\[
\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_p}
\]

where:
- \( R_p \) is the expected portfolio return.
- \( R_f \) is the risk-free rate of return (often the yield on government bonds).
- \( \sigma_p \) is the standard deviation of the portfolio's excess return (i.e., the portfolio's risk).

### Annualized Sharpe Ratio

When you calculate the Sharpe Ratio on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, you often want to annualize it to make it comparable to other investments or benchmarks that are typically measured on an annual basis.

To annualize the Sharpe Ratio, you adjust for the time period over which the returns are measured. If your returns are calculated on a daily basis, the annualized Sharpe Ratio is given by:

\[
\text{Annualized Sharpe Ratio} = \text{Sharpe Ratio} \times \sqrt{T}
\]

where:
- \( T \) is the number of periods in a year. For example:
  - For daily returns: \( T = 252 \) (assuming 252 trading days in a year).
  - For weekly returns: \( T = 52 \).
  - For monthly returns: \( T = 12 \).

### Example Calculation

Suppose you have a portfolio with the following data:
- Daily return of the portfolio: 0.05%
- Daily risk-free rate: 0.01%
- Standard deviation of daily excess returns: 1.2%

First, compute the Sharpe Ratio:

\[
\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{0.0005 - 0.0001}{0.012} = \frac{0.0004}{0.012} = 0.0333
\]

Then, annualize the Sharpe Ratio:

\[
\text{Annualized Sharpe Ratio} = 0.0333 \times \sqrt{252} \approx 0.0333 \times 15.87 = 0.5289
\]

This annualized Sharpe Ratio gives you a way to compare your portfolio's risk-adjusted performance with other portfolios or benchmarks that are typically measured on an annual basis.

## 11. Semi-Deviation and Value-at-Risk 

### Introduction to Alternative Risk Measures: Semi-Deviation and Value-at-Risk (VaR)

When evaluating the risk of a portfolio, traditional measures like standard deviation and the Sharpe Ratio are widely used. However, these measures have limitations, particularly when dealing with non-normal return distributions or when investors are more concerned with downside risk. To address these concerns, alternative risk measures like **semi-deviation** and **Value-at-Risk (VaR)** are often employed.

### Semi-Deviation: Focusing on Downside Risk

#### Understanding Semi-Deviation

**Semi-deviation** is a measure of risk that focuses specifically on the downside—returns that fall below a certain threshold, typically the mean or zero. Unlike standard deviation, which considers both positive and negative deviations from the mean, semi-deviation only measures the variability of returns that are below the mean.

Mathematically, semi-deviation is defined as:

\[
\text{Semi-Deviation} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \min(R_i - \bar{R}, 0)^2}
\]

Where:
- \(R_i\) represents the individual returns.
- \(\bar{R}\) is the mean return.
- The function \(\min(R_i - \bar{R}, 0)\) ensures that only the negative deviations (downside risk) are considered.

#### Why Use Semi-Deviation?

Semi-deviation is particularly useful when investors are more concerned with minimizing losses rather than the overall variability of returns. It gives a better understanding of the risk of "bad" outcomes, making it more relevant for risk-averse investors.

### Value-at-Risk (VaR): A Quantitative Risk Metric

#### Understanding Value-at-Risk (VaR)

**Value-at-Risk (VaR)** is a widely used risk measure that quantifies the potential loss in value of a portfolio over a specific time period for a given confidence level. VaR answers the question: *What is the worst-case loss that could occur with a certain probability over a given time horizon?*

There are three main methods to calculate VaR:

1. **Historical Simulation**: Uses historical return data to simulate the potential losses.
2. **Variance-Covariance Method**: Assumes a normal distribution of returns and calculates VaR based on the portfolio's standard deviation.
3. **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Uses random sampling to simulate a wide range of possible outcomes and estimate potential losses.

#### VaR Formula (Variance-Covariance Method)

For a portfolio with a normal distribution of returns, VaR can be calculated using:

\[
\text{VaR} = Z_{\alpha} \times \sigma_p \times \sqrt{t}
\]

Where:
- \(Z_{\alpha}\) is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (e.g., 1.65 for 95% confidence).
- \(\sigma_p\) is the portfolio's standard deviation.
- \(t\) is the time horizon over which VaR is calculated.

For example, a 95% one-day VaR of $1 million means that there's a 5% chance the portfolio could lose more than $1 million in one day.

#### Why Use VaR?

VaR is popular because it provides a single, easy-to-understand metric for potential losses. It’s widely used by financial institutions for risk management and regulatory reporting. However, VaR has limitations, such as assuming a normal distribution of returns (in some methods) and not accounting for extreme tail events (which is addressed by measures like Conditional VaR or Expected Shortfall).

### Summary of Key Differences

| **Measure**      | **Focus**                                  | **Advantages**                                               | **Disadvantages**                                         |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Semi-Deviation** | Downside risk (negative deviations)        | More relevant for risk-averse investors; highlights downside | Ignores upside potential; may underestimate total risk     |
| **Value-at-Risk** (VaR) | Potential loss over a given time period at a specific confidence level | Widely understood and used; provides a clear risk metric      | May underestimate risk in non-normal distributions; does not capture extreme tail risk |

### Conclusion

Both semi-deviation and VaR offer valuable insights into different aspects of risk that standard deviation and Sharpe Ratio might miss. Semi-deviation is particularly useful when you want to focus on downside risk, while VaR is a robust tool for quantifying potential losses over a specified period. Understanding and using these measures can lead to better-informed investment decisions, particularly in portfolios where downside protection is a priority.

## 12. Capital Asset Pricing Model

The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a fundamental concept in finance that explains the relationship between the expected return of an investment and its risk. Here's a breakdown of how it works, how investors are compensated for risk, and the concept of the Security Market Line (SML).

### 1. **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**

The CAPM formula is used to determine the expected return on an asset based on its risk relative to the market:

\[
E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_i \times (E(R_m) - R_f)
\]

Where:
- \( E(R_i) \) = Expected return on the investment
- \( R_f \) = Risk-free rate (the return on a risk-free asset, like government bonds)
- \( \beta_i \) = Beta of the investment (a measure of how much the investment's returns move relative to the market)
- \( E(R_m) \) = Expected return of the market
- \( E(R_m) - R_f \) = Market risk premium (the additional return expected from holding a risky market portfolio instead of risk-free assets)

### 2. **Compensating Investors for Risk**

Investors are compensated for taking on additional risk through the risk premium. In the CAPM:

- **Risk-Free Rate (\( R_f \))**: This is the return an investor would expect from a completely risk-free investment. It serves as the baseline for any investment return.
  
- **Market Risk Premium (\( E(R_m) - R_f \))**: The extra return expected by investors for holding a market portfolio instead of risk-free assets. This compensates investors for the systematic risk they cannot diversify away.

- **Beta (\( \beta \))**: This measures the sensitivity of an asset's returns to the returns of the market. A higher beta means the asset is more volatile and therefore riskier. Consequently, investors expect a higher return as compensation for bearing this additional risk.

### 3. **Security Market Line (SML)**

The Security Market Line (SML) is a graphical representation of the CAPM. It plots the relationship between the expected return of a security and its beta:

- **X-axis**: Beta (\( \beta \))
- **Y-axis**: Expected return (\( E(R) \))

The SML is upward sloping, indicating that as the beta (risk) increases, the expected return also increases. The slope of the SML is the market risk premium (\( E(R_m) - R_f \)).

#### **Key Points on the SML:**
- **Intercept**: The intercept on the Y-axis is the risk-free rate (\( R_f \)).
- **Slope**: The slope of the line represents the market risk premium.
- **Positioning of Assets**:
  - **Above the SML**: If a security plots above the SML, it is considered undervalued because it offers a higher return for its level of risk.
  - **Below the SML**: If a security plots below the SML, it is considered overvalued because it offers a lower return for its level of risk.

### Example:

Imagine two assets, A and B:
- Asset A has a beta of 1.5, meaning it's more volatile than the market.
- Asset B has a beta of 0.5, meaning it's less volatile than the market.
- If the risk-free rate is 2% and the expected market return is 8%, the expected returns for these assets would be:

\[
E(R_A) = 2\% + 1.5 \times (8\% - 2\%) = 11\%
\]
\[
E(R_B) = 2\% + 0.5 \times (8\% - 2\%) = 5\%
\]

Asset A, being riskier, offers a higher expected return of 11%, while Asset B offers 5%.

### Summary:

- **CAPM** helps estimate the expected return based on the risk (beta) of an asset.
- **Investors are compensated for risk** through the risk premium.
- The **Security Market Line** visually represents this relationship, with the slope indicating how much additional return is expected per unit of risk.

This model is widely used in finance to assess whether an investment is fairly valued given its risk.
